- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flamescreen
- 👀 I’m interested in modding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to mod GalacticIVSuperNova, HoMM VII+ and other games handling UE4 and UDK, Blender, and AI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much really. I have my own vision on what I want to see and I understand that someone elses' entirelly or in crucial enough parts.
- 📫 How to reach me: I will eventually modify this line with communication data. Note; that might take a while till I have something to present my work in the modding scene through.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: They call me professor, and I have been a professor - after I got the nickname.
